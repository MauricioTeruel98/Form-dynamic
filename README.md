# Form-dynamic

<h2>In this project we see how when we press the button to close the form, the data already entered is saved in a variable, even if not all the form boxes have been completed</h2>
<h3>Inside the folders are the instructions to rebuild the Node js packages</h3>

<h2>The app has two views, one for the data entry form, and the other view to see the list of all contacts</h2>

<h2>Form view: localhost:PORT/</h2>

<h2>Form view: localhost:PORT/list</h2>
